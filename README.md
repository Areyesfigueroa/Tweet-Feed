## Description
This project utilizes the Twitter API, which communicates with my internal API using Nodejs and Expressjs. In this application, you can search tweets in a user's timeline or use search all tweets by content. Users will also be able to see random tweets from my favorite list of Twitter user accounts, or you can press a button to select a random user and a random tweet from my list. 

Working on this project has taught me a lot of how backend and frontend communicate by utilizing the Express.js framework and Node.js. I've learned about hosting my server through Express to create my API to filter/parse data from Twitter's API. This knowledge will help me prepare for larger projects where a middleware API is needed to facilitate communication between multiple applications.
